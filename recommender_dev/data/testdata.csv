How cells lacking DDRs cope with broken chromosomes during mitosis is poorly understood. DDRs are frequently inactivated in cells with extra genomes (polyploidy), suggesting that study of polyploidy can reveal how cells with impaired DDRs/genome damage continue dividing. Here, we show that continued division and normal organ development occurs in polyploid, DDR-impaired Drosophila papillar cells. As papillar cells become polyploid, they naturally accumulate broken acentric chromosomes but do not apoptose/arrest the cell cycle. To survive mitosis with acentric chromosomes, papillar cells require Fanconi anemia proteins FANCD2 and FANCI, as well as Blm helicase, but not canonical DDR signaling. FANCD2 acts independently of previous S phases to promote alignment and segregation of acentric DNA produced by double-strand breaks, thus avoiding micronuclei and organ malformation. Because polyploidy and impaired DDRs can promote cancer, our findings provide insight into disease-relevant DNA-damage tolerance mechanisms."19465921,"Loss-of-function of caretaker genes characterizes a group of cancer predisposition diseases that feature cellular hypersensitivity to DNA damage and chromosome fragility; this group includes Fanconi anaemia and Bloom syndrome. The products of the 13 FANC genes (mutated in Fanconi anaemia), which constitute the 'FANC' pathway, and BLM (the RecQ helicase mutated in Bloom syndrome) are thought to collaborate during the S phase of the cell cycle, preventing chromosome instability. Recently, BLM has been implicated in the completion of sister chromatid separation during mitosis, a complex process in which precise regulation and execution is crucial to preserve genomic stability. Here we show for the first time a role for the FANC pathway in chromosome segregation during mitotic cell division. FANCD2, a key component of the pathway, localizes to discrete spots on mitotic chromosomes. FANCD2 chromosomal localization is responsive to replicative stress and specifically targets aphidicolin (APH)-induced chromatid gaps and breaks. Our data indicate that the FANC pathway is involved in rescuing abnormal anaphase and telophase (ana-telophase) cells, limiting aneuploidy and reducing chromosome instability in daughter cells. We further address a cooperative role for the FANC pathway and BLM in preventing micronucleation, through FANC-dependent targeting of BLM to non-centromeric abnormal structures induced by replicative stress. We reveal new crosstalk between FANC and BLM proteins, extending their interaction beyond the S-phase rescue of damaged DNA to the safeguarding of chromosome stability during mitosis."28258153,"Pulmonaryætuberculosisæ(TB) caused byæMycobacterium tuberculosisæ(Mtb) is a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality. The only licensed TB vaccine,æMycobacteriumæbovisæbacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), has variable efficacy in protecting against pulmonary TB. Thus, the development of more effective TB vaccines is critical to control the TB epidemic. Specifically, vaccines delivered through the mucosal route are known to induce Th17 responses and provide superior protection againstæMtbæinfection. However, already tested Th17-inducing mucosal adjuvants, such as heat-labile enterotoxins and cholera toxins, are not considered safe for use in humans. In the current study, we rationally screened adjuvants for their ability to induce Th17-polarizing cytokines in dendritic cells (DCs) and determined whether they could be used in a protective mucosal TB vaccine. Our new studies show that monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), when used in combination with chitosan, potently induces Th17-polarizing cytokines in DCs and downstream Th17/Th1 mucosal responses and confers significant protection in mice challenged with a clinicalæMtbæstrain. Additionally, we show that both TLRs and the inflammasome pathways are activated in DCs by MPL-chitosan to mediate induction of Th17-polarizing cytokines. Together, our studies put forward the potential of a new, protective mucosal TB vaccine candidate, which incorporates safe adjuvants already approved for use in humans."25398087,"Tuberculosisæ(TB) is an infectious disease caused byæMycobacterium tuberculosisæ(Mtb) that is a major public health problem. The vaccine used for TB prevention isæMycobacteriumæbovis bacillus Calmette-Gu_rin (BCG), which provides variable efficacy in protecting against pulmonary TB among adults. Consequently, several groups have pursued the development of a new vaccine with a superior protective capacity to that of BCG. Here we constructed a new recombinant BCG (rBCG) vaccine expressing a fusion protein (CMX) composed of immune dominant epitopes from Ag85C, MPT51, and HspX and evaluated its immunogenicity and protection in a murine model of infection. The stability of the vaccine in vivo was maintained for up to 20 days post-vaccination. rBCG-CMX was efficiently phagocytized by peritoneal macrophages and induced nitric oxide (NO) production. Following mouse immunization, this vaccine induced a specific immune response in cells from lungs and spleen to the fusion protein and to each of the component recombinant proteins by themselves. Vaccinated mice presented higher amounts of Th1, Th17, and polyfunctional specific T cells. rBCG-CMX vaccination reduced the extension of lung lesions caused by challenge with Mtb as well as the lung bacterial load. In addition, when this vaccine was used in a prime-boost strategy together with rCMX, the lung bacterial load was lower than the result observed by BCG vaccination. This study describes the creation of a new promising vaccine for TB that we hope will be used in further studies to address its safety before proceeding to clinical trials."
