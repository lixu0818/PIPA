# PIPA (PubMed Intelligent Personal Assistant)
----

Scientific researchers spend a lot of time to read literatures coming out in the field. Keeping up with the relevant papers is very important for designing experiments and writing grant proposals. As the largest collection of biomedical literature, Pubmed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ pubmed), comprises more than 26 million publications from life science journals and books. Although hundreds of millions of researchers depend heavily on Pubmed’s update, its service seems to be too basic and not very user-friendly. 

Here, I build a smart recommendation web app that can crawl paper information like abstracts from Pubmed and train itself for literature association. Then it takes user’s previous reading as input, uses content-based filtering to predict the most relevant literatures and recommends them to the users everyday. My app will get started by asking my users to provide a short description of their research area, or articles they are most interested in, and recommend similar articles from Pubmed based on content analysis.
